			<LI>Review proposed codes?
			<LI>View proposed LOINC / SNOMED codes for answer lists
		</UL>
		<LI>Edit
		<UL>
			<LI>Propose LOINC codes for individual items (view static contents, give box for submitting LOINC code
			<LI>Code submission table: {user, item primary key, time, codeset (LOINC, SNOMED, UMLS), codeval, [reason]} so
