		</UL>
		<LI>Formative
		<UL>
			<LI>Keypunching vs. Encoding  rate
			<LI>Inter-rater reliability of adding LOINC codes
			<LI>Development and testing of distance metrics for assessing the relationship between items (e.g. keyword searches,
			fuzzy phrase searches, natural language processing, etc.)
			<LI>Focus groups of experts re which of these distance metrics have the highest face validity and ease of use
			<LI>Inter-rater reliability of using these distance metrics to detect relationships among items and between them
			and other UMLS terms (e.g. SNOMED)

	</UL>
	<LI>STAFFING NEEDS
	<UL>
		<LI>Researcher to compile list of instruments from multiple sources
		<UL>
			<LI>triage which should be encoded (based upon current references in the literature
			<LI>which are used by states and providers (large stakeholders)?
			<LI>which are encoded in commercial EMRs, and what terminologies (if any) do they use?
			<LI>obtain copies of those instruments
		</UL>
		<LI>Legal to arrange permissions to properly license for this purpose
		<LI>Data coders to keypunch the contents
		<LI>Knowledge engineers to find relationships with existing UMLS terms (good search function)
		<LI>Programmers / DBs for instrastructure
		<UL>
			<LI>DB for storing
			<LI>distributed authoring
			<LI>one-many comparison to existing instruments
		</UL>
		<LI>Contact OVID see if their DBs show how many have shared copyright, and # of items within the instruments
