scoreIntro	scoreIntro		1	[		<b>Short DPS (Youth Version) - Scoring Information</b><p>The Short DPS screens for PTSD, Major Depression and Anxiety disorderss that may be seen in children and adolescents as responses to traumatic events.  Questions are divided into diagnostic sections (A-F) and a section that measures impairment in functioning due to the presence of symptoms (Section G).  The decision to regard someone as "screen positive" requires both symptoms plus impairment.</p><p>Two "cut-off" scores are presented for each diagnostic section - a "warning" score and a "diagnostic" score.  If it is thought important not to miss any cases of a particular disorder then individuals with a section score equal or greater to the warning value will be most accurate.  However, this approach may identify a significant number of "false positives".  Alternatively, if it is felt appropriate to target further evaluation only to those subjects with the highest likelihood of having a diagnosis, then individuals with a section score equal or greater to the diagnostic value should be selected.  However, this approach may miss some cases who do have a disorder (false negatives).</p><p>To be considered screen positive, subjects must meet warning or diagnostic threshold in one or more symptoms areas AND to report significant impairment in one or more domains.</p>Further evaluation may also be indicated in sub-threshold cases, when there is external concern by others (e.g. parents/teachers) or in response to self-identified need (Q43).	nothing
