	overall_intro_1		1	[		This is an implementation of the <b>New York City Department of Health</b> guideline for testing and treatment of <b>Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI)</b>. <br>The guideline is composed of five basic steps:  <br>1)   decide who should be tested.  <br>2)  decide if the tuberculin skin test (TST) is positive.  <br>3)  evaluate for the presence of active disease.  <br>4)  select a treatment regimen for latent infection. <br>5)  make any adjustments for HIV-positive patients.	nothing	
	overall_intro_2		1	]		It operationalizes the guideline to help you decide whether a tuberculin skin test is necessary and, if one has been done, to decide how to interpret the test and handle positive results.<br><br>Tuberculin skin testing should only take place when a plan has been developed for persons to complete a course of treatment if found to have latent TB infection.  <br><b>Remember, a decision to test is a commitment to treat!</b>	nothing

Therefore a regimen containing other drugs active against M. tuberculosis should be considered.  When possible, selection of drugs should be guided by in vitro susceptibility test results on an isolate obtained from the person to whom the patient was exposed.  Immunocompetent contacts may be observed without treatment or treated for at least 6 months.  HIV-infected persons should be treated for 12 months.  All persons with suspected MDRTB infection should be followed for at least 2 years, irrespective of treatment.

	pregnant_TST_positive		(should_treat_LTBI == 1) && (pregnant == 1)	q		Although the need for treatment of active TB during pregnancy is unquestioned, the treatment of LTBI in pregnant women is more controversial because the possible risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity must be weighed against the risk of developing active TB.  In general, treatment of LTBI should be delayed until after delivery.  However, for women who are HIV-positive or who have been infected recently, initiation of thereapy should not be delayed on the basis of pregnancy alone, even during the first trimester.<br><br>The preferred regimen for treatment of LTB in pregnant women is INH (daily or twice weekly).  Extensive use of INH during pregancy has indicated that the drug is not teratogenic, even when given during the first 4 months of pregnancy.  Pregnant women taking INH should receive vitamin B6.  In general, pyrazinamide should not be used for the treatment of LTBI in pregnant women.	nothing
