Workers' Dilemma</B><BR>Due to some seemingly unfounded dismissals, some factory workers suspect the managers of eavesdropping on their employees through an intercom and using this information against them.  The managers officially and emphatically deny this accusation.  The union declares that it will only take steps against the company when proof has been found that confirms these suspicions.  Two workers then break into the administrative offices and take tape transcripts that prove the allegation of eavesdropping."	nothing
