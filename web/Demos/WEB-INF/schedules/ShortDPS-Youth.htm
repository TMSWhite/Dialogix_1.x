Questions are divided into diagnostic sections (A-F) and a section that measures impairment in functioning due to the presence of symptoms (Section G).  The decision to regard someone as "screen positive" requires both symptoms plus impairment.</p><p>Two "cut-off" scores are presented for each diagnostic section - a "warning" score and a "diagnostic" score.  If it is thought important not to miss any cases of a particular disorder then individuals with a section score equal or greater to the warning value will be most accurate.  However, this approach may identify a significant number of "false positives".  Alternatively, if it is felt appropriate to target further evaluation only to those subjects with the highest likelihood of having a diagnosis, then individuals with a section score equal or greater to the diagnostic value should be selected.  However, this approach may miss some cases who do have a disorder (false negatives).</p><p>To be considered screen positive, subjects must meet warning or diagnostic threshold in one or more symptoms areas AND to report significant impairment in one or more domains.</p>Further evaluation may also be indicated in sub-threshold cases, when there is external concern by others (e.g. parents/teachers) or in response to self-identified need (Q43).</td><td><font color='blue'><b>[Data type = </b>instructions]</font></td></tr>
