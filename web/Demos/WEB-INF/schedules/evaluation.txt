Introduction	welcome screen		1	[		Thank you for evaluating the <b>Triceps System</b>!!	nothing
	_tmp0000		1	q		During the course of this evaluation you will be shown the basic features of the display and some examples of what kinds of human-computer interactions are possible with <B>Triceps</b>.  Along the way you will be asked what you think so we can devise improvements.	nothing
	username		1	]		But first, please type in your name:	text
	display_username		1	q		Thanks, `username`!  <br><br>With <b>Triceps</b> it is easy to refer to previous answers (like your name above) and with them modify the text of subsequent displays and even the flow of the whole interaction.  As this evaluation proceeds you will see numerous examples of how this dynamic customization of the interview occurs.	nothing
	_tmp0001		1	e		__HEADER_MSG__ = "Using The Triceps Display"	nothing
	_tmp0002		1	[		The <b>Triceps</b> interface is a regular web browser.  Inside the browser window	nothing
	_tmp0003		1	q		One navigates the screen in usual browser fashion with either the mouse or keyboard.  <br>	nothing
	_tmp0004		1	q		<b>MOUSE: </b>The mouse allows you to click buttons, like the <b>next</b> and <b>previous</b> buttons below.  You can click icons, like the question mark icon in the upper left-hand corner which provides general system help.  You can select radio buttons and check boxes in the usual fashion.  And you can move the cursor and focus to where you will enter text or numbers.	nothing
	_tmp0005		1	]		<b>KEYBOARD: </b>It is possible to rapidly navigate the page with keystrokes alone.  However, this depends heavily on what type of browser you are using.  <b>Triceps</b> is currently optimized for Netscape navigator 4.x on MS Windows.  The TAB key cycles the focus trhough text fields (if any) and the navigation buttons.   In pull-down menus, the up and down arrow keys move the focus between options or you can hit the key corresponding to the first letter or number of the option to move the focus directly there.	nothing
	_tmp0006		1	e		__HEADER_MSG__ = 'What is the Triceps System?'	nothing
	_tmp0007		1	[		<b>Triceps</b> is designed to make defining and deploying any kind of structured human-computer interaction easy.  Researchers, clinicians, and educators commonly need to collect and distribute information that has a standard structure and content on the one hand, but is also appropriate to the circumstances of the exchange and the particular characteristics of the subject, patient, or student on the other.	nothing
	_tmp0008		1	q		The system is composed of 4 basic parts:<br>1)  spreadsheet<br>2)  a servlet<br>3) a browser<br>4) data files	nothing
	_tmp0009		1	q		The <i>spreadsheet</i> (a tab-delimited text file) is where the schedule is defined that governs the human-computer interaction.  Each row in the spreadsheet defines a node.	nothing
	_tmp0010		1	q		The <i>servlet</i> (TricepsServlet and its associated files) reads the spreadsheet and traverses the nodes in order from start to finish.	nothing
	_tmp0011		1	q		The <i>browser</i> is the user interface to the servlet.	nothing
	_tmp0012		1	q		The <i>data file</i> is built as an interview proceeds.	nothing
	_tmp0013		1	]		In a nutshell, one defines the schedule in the spreadsheet and deploys it by configuring the servlet to run it then starting and runing it with the browser.	nothing
	_tmp0014		1	e		__HEADER_MSG__ = "Defining a Schedule"	nothing
	_tmp0015		1	[		One uses any spreasheet program to define a schedule.  Each row is a <i>node</i> that defines a discrete step to take in the interview, for example, displaying text in the browser or performing an internal evaluation of previous answers.	nothing
	_tmp0016		1	q		A <i>node</i> includes a field of <i>dependencies</i>.  Before a node's action is performed these dependencies are evaluated to see if that node is applicable under the circumstances.	nothing
	_tmp0017		1	q		For example, at one node one might ask for the interviewee's gender.  A subsequent node asking about pregnancies would only be asked if the gender node answer was "female".	nothing
	_tmp0018		1	]		There are two important points to note about using dependencies like this.  First, each node explicitly specifies the circumstances in which it is applicable.  In the example given, the node about pregnancy is performed only if the interviewee is female.   Second, one does not have to record a "goto" for each answer option at a given node.  This eliminates the difficulty of following the flow of a schedule through all the possible paths.  In <b>Triceps</b>, all nodes are considered in order from start to finish.	nothing
