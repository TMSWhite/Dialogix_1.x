This is not a method for self-diagnosis, but it can help you assess the severity and timing of certain symptoms of depression.  You should answer these questions privately -- for your personal use -- and make separate copies of the questionnaire if family members or friends want to use it.</td><td><font color='blue'><b>[Data type = </b>instructions]</font></td></tr>

		<tr><td>55</td><td>ReportC</td><td>1</td><td><b>Part 3.</b><i>[Dialogix is currently unable to automate this section]</i><p>People with <i>fall or winter</i> depression tend to score 4 or more per month in a series of 3-5 months beginning anywhere from September to January, as would be noted in Column A. For months outside that grouping the score tends to be zero, or nearly zero. In Column B, the same people will usually score 4 or more points per month over a series of 3-5 months beginning anywhere from March to June. Some people show a different pattern, with scores <i>split</i> between Columns A and B during both winter and summer months. For example, they may feel worst and socialize least during the summer, especially July and August; during the same time period, they may eat least, lose most weight, and sleep least. In winter, they may feel best and socialize most, yet still tend to eat most, gain most weight, and sleep most. Such people may experience seasonal depression of the <i>summer</i> type, and treatment recommendations may well differ from those for winter depression. Some people show <i>relatively</i> high scores in the fall and winter months in Column A (winter depression), but there is still a remaining scatter of good and bad months <i>throughout</i> the year. Such a pattern may indicate a 'winter worsening' of symptoms, rather than clear-cut SAD. Recommendations for winter treatment might be similar to those for winter-SAD, although there may be a need for multiple treatment approaches. Some people experience depression in the winter as well as in the summer, but they feel fine in the spring and the fall. Their summer depression is usually not accompanied by oversleeping and overeating, in contrast with the winter. This is a special case of SAD, for which  different treatments might be appropriate in the opposite seasons. Even people who experience only winter depression sometimes feel summertime slumps in mood and  energy when the weather is rainy or dark for several days. They often find relief by brief use of their winter treatment during these periods. </p></td><td><font color='blue'><b>[Data type = </b>instructions]</font></td></tr>
