	Intro		1	[		A patient is considered to have extrapyramidal signs if any <i>one</i> sign is present and has a severity rating of 2 or more.  Patients with drug-induced extrapyramidal signs cannot be evaluated using the AD prediction techniques.  When deciding whether a sign is drug-induced, consider primary psychotics, particularly phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressants	nothing
