	q1		1	q		Welcome to the second <b>Dialogix</b> tutorial, written by <a href="mailto:thomas.white@dmi.columbia.edu">Thomas White</a>.<br><br>Over the next 5 minutes, you will learn how safe Dialogix is.<br><br>Please press the <b>next</b> button below to continue.<br><br>If the text is too <u>small</u>, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press type the <b>]</b> key to make the text larger.<br>If the text is too <u>large</u>, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press type the <b>[</b> key to make the text smaller.	nothing
	q2a		1	[		<b>SAFETY</b><br>Dialogix makes it impossible for an author (e.g. of a tutorial, interview, or questionnaire, etc.) to damage your computer.<br><br>Similarly, there is nothing that you can type, click, or paste that will cause Dialogix to crash.	nothing
	q2b		1	q		Dialogix protects you by making sure that authors can't accidentally or maliciously insert viruses or bad code into their questions.<br><br>Dialogix does this by filtering the questions that the authors want to ask, and removes any dangerous parts.  For those of you familiar with HTML, Dialogix does not allow the author to insert any <object>, <embed>, or <script> tags.  If they try, you will see the code they tried to enter (like <b><object>delete all files</object></b> or <b><embed>have virus attack computer</embed></b>) but the code will <u>never</u> be run.	nothing
	q2c		1	]		Dialogix also protects you (and the author) by making sure there is nothing you can do to break Dialogix, or the interview.  Even if you try to maliciously break Dialogix (e.g. by "accidentally" pasting a 64K buffer of control characters into a Comment field), the worst you can do is to crash Netscape, or your local computer (if it is running Windows).  If you were to do this (and I have tested this myself), you would be able to <b>Restore</b> the interview from exactly where you left off.	nothing
	q3a		1	[		<b>PRIVACY</b><br>Dialogix also protects your privacy in a number of ways.	nothing
	q3b		1	q		First, you are often allowed to <b>Refuse</b> to answer a question.  Of course, the authors don't want you to do this, but if you are asked sensitive questions, you should always be given this option.<br><br>For example, what is your name?	text
	q3c		1	]		Second, Dialogix ensures that you are always able to go back and change your answers if you make a mistake (or later decide to answer a question you initially refused to answer)	nothing
	q4a		1	[		<b>WHAT INFORMATION DOES DIALOGIX COLLECT?</b><br>Dialogix collects both answer and process information	nothing
	q4b		1	q		<b>Answers</b>:  For each question, Dialogix collects the following data<table width="100%" border="1"><tr><td>questionName</td><td>This is the variable name that the authors/researchers will use to track the answers to the question</td></tr><tr><td>languageNum</td><td>Since instruments can be written in several languages, it is important to know the language being used to ask a particular quation</td></tr><tr><td>timeStamp</td><td>The time at which the question was answered - questions that take a long time to answer may be too complex or be poorly worded</td></tr><tr><td>questionAsAsked</td><td>As you have seen, the questions are tailord to the information you enter, such as your name or gender.  In order to validate the questions, it is important to keep track of exactly how the question was asked</td></tr><tr><td>answerGiven</td><td>This is the answer you gave to the question</td></tr><tr><td>comment</td><td>For each question, you can add an optional comment - like pointing out typos or concerns to the author</td></tr></table>	nothing
	q4c		1	q		<b>Process</b>:  For each question, Dialogix collects information on how you answered the question.  This can be used to track down problems.  This has been helpful to authors developing large-scale studies, like those listed on the opening page.  For example, the people testing or administering the instrument might report that the computer keeps crashing.  The researcher can review the process log to see exactly what Dialogix and the interviewer were doing when the system crashed.  This makes it easier for them to quickly track down and fix bugs in their intruments.	nothing
	q4d		1	]		For each question, Dialogix collects the following <b>process</b> information:<br>which buttons were pressed, and when<br>what keys were typed, and when<br>what question was the user working on	nothing
	q5a		1	[		<b>ERROR TRACKING</b><br>Dialogix can not crash.  However, if it is not installed correctly it will display a few predictable and safe, but annoying behaviors.  For example, the icons might not load, or you can't start an interview.  Once an interview starts, however (even if you can't see the icons), Dialogix is guaranteed to work properly.<br><br>Dialogix has a log file that records debugging information to help the system administrator ensure that Dialogix is installed correctly.	nothing
