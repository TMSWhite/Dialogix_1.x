	q1		1	q		Welcome to the first <b>Dialogix</b> tutorial, written by <a href="mailto:thomas.white@dmi.columbia.edu">Thomas White</a>.<br><br>Over the next 5 minutes, you will learn how to use Dialogix.<br><br>Please press the <b>next</b> button below to continue.<br><br>If the text is too <u>small</u>, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press type the <b>]</b> key to make the text larger.<br>If the text is too <u>large</u>, hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key and press type the <b>[</b> key to make the text smaller.	nothing
	q2		1	q		As you can see, Dialogix is a web-based program.  It is optimized to run under Netscape Navigator, version 4.7 or higher.<br><br>You can return to previous slides at any time using the <b>previous</b> button below.<br><br>  (You can either click on buttons with the mouse, or use the <b>Tab</b> key to get to it, then press the <b>Enter</b> key to activate it)	nothing
	name		1	q		Dialogix uses web-based forms to ask questions.<br><br>For example, please enter your <u>first name</u> to the right, then <b>Tab</b> to the <b>next</b> button.and press <b>Enter</b><br><br>If you don't answer a question, you will be told to <b>Please answer the question(s) listed in  <font color='red'>RED </font>before proceeding</b>, and Dialogix will tell you what sort of answer it expects (Try it!)	text
	_tmp1		isRefused(name)	q		Please don't refuse to enter a name.  I want to show you how Dialogix can personalize an interview.  Feel free to make up a name, if you want	nothing
	male		1	q		Thanks, `name`.  Now, please tell me whether you prefer to be called "she" or "he"<br><br>You can select your choice using either the mouse, the arrow keys, or the number keys.  	list|0|she|1|he
	q4		1	q		Ok `name`, I will address you as <b>`(male)?'he':'she'`</b>.  Your gender is more important for the Spanish version of this tutorial, since it affects how I should conjugate the verbs and decline the nouns.<br><br>You might have found it odd that I didn't ask whether you are male or female.  This is because there are plenty of individuals who don't easily fit into those two categories.  Sometimes when I run across questionnaires that exhibit that sort of gender bias, I want to email the web-site to let them know my feelings.<br><br>Dialogix lets you use <b>Comments</b> to tell the questionnaire designer what you think (or <a href="mailto:thomas.white@dmi.columbia.edu">tutorial designer</a>, in this case).  You may have noticed the comment icon - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __COMMENT_ICON_OFF__`' align='top' border='0' > - on the previous two slides.  If you click it, you will be asked to "Enter a comment for this question".  The icon will cange to - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __COMMENT_ICON_ON__`' align='top' border='0' > - to let you know that you have entered a comment (and back to the original if you erase it).  Use the <b>previous</b> button to go back and give it a try.	nothing
	q5		1	q		Ok, `name`, please feel free to use the comment button to let me know if you find any parts of this tutorial confusing (or if you find any typos).<br><br>You may also have noticed the Refused icon - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __REFUSED_ICON_OFF__`' align='top' border='0' >.  It lets you refuse to answer questions that you don't like.  If you click it, it will cange to - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __REFUSED_ICON_ON__`' align='top' border='0' > - to indicate that are refusing to answer this question.  In such cases, the answer you enter is ignored.  If you decide to answer a question you previously refused, you need to unclick the refused icon, so that it turns back to the default of - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __REFUSED_ICON_OFF__`' align='top' border='0' ><br><br>Try going back and refusing to enter your name or gender.	nothing

	q7		aAGE != tAGE	q;number;1;0		`name`, I think you made a typo.  If you were born on <b>`DOB`</b>, you would be <b>`tAGE`</b> today, not <b>`aAGE`</b>.<br><br>Please go back and fix the typo.<br><br>(I won't let you proceed with the tutorial until you fix the typo)	password
	q8		1	q		OK, `name`, the age you entered, and the age calculated based on your birthday match.<br><br>If you told the truth, you were born on <b>`toWeekday(DOB)`, `toMonth(DOB)` `toDay(DOB)`, `toYear(DOB)`</b>.	nothing
	q9		1	q		There are two other icons you might see in some interviews.<br><br>If you don't know the answer to a question (e.g. <i>"do you have a family history of Disease XYZ?"</i>), you can use the DoNotKnow (Unknown) option - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __UNKNOWN_ICON_OFF__`' align='top' border='0' > and <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __UNKNOWN_ICON_ON__`' align='top' border='0' >.<br><br>If you don't understand the question itself, you can use the DoNotUnderstand option - <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __DONT_UNDERSTAND_ICON_OFF__`' align='top' border='0' > and <img name='_tmp' src='`__IMAGE_FILES_DIR__ . __DONT_UNDERSTAND_ICON_ON__`' align='top' border='0' >.	nothing

	q10g		1	];number;0;(tAGE-10);;77;88;99		Enter the age of your oldest child.  <br>Use 99 if you refuse to answer, <br>88 if you don't have any children, or <br>77 if you don't know how old that child is	double
	q11a		1	[		Other times, you will be asked to select one of a few specific choices.  Depending upon the author of the interview, you may have several different ways of making these choices.  Below are some examples.<br><br>Personally, I find the list box approach best, since I can see all of the options, and I can use the number keys to quickly select my answer.	nothing
