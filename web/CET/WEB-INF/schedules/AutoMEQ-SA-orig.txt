Intro2	Intro2		1	q		Below you will find a series of 19 questions about your daily sleep-wake habits and the times of day that you prefer to perform certain activities.  This questionnaire should take about 5-10 minutes.  After answering all the questions, you will receive the following feedback:<ol><li>your morningness-eveningness score</li><li>your "type" relative to other people</li><li>an estimate of when your brain starts to produce the hormone melatonin in the evening or at night</li><li>an estimate of your "natural bedtime" as guided by your internal body clock, and</li><li>an estimate of the optimum morning interval to use bright light therapy if you are suffering from winter depression (seasonal affective disorder).</li></ol>You should use this questionnaire only if your preferred bedtime falls between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m., and your preferred wake-up time falls between 5 a.m. and 12 noon.  This questionnaire is not suitable for people with major sleep-wake disorders and those who normally sleep outside of the specified range. <br /> <br />For each question, please select the answer that best describes you.  Make your judgments based on how you have felt in recent weeks. <br /> <br />As soon as you complete the questionnaire, you will receive screen feedback with your results, and you will also be able to print out your answers to all the questions. <br /> <br />	nothing

Feedback4	Feedback4		1	q		The time you are first able to fall asleep easily (assuming that you keep a regular sleep schedule) is related to the time that your brain begins to produce melatonin in the evening or at night. <br /> <br /><b>WE ESTIMATE THAT YOUR "NATURAL" BEDTIME IS AT ABOUT <i>`SL_ONSET_time`</i></b>. <br />	nothing
Feedback5	Feedback5		1	q		If you are suffering from winter depression and are planning to use light therapy*, your score can suggest the time of day that you will get the quickest, strongest antidepressant response from treatment. <br /> <br /><b>WE ESTIMATE THAT YOUR OPTIMUM 30-MIN LIGHT TREATMENT SHOULD BEGIN AT <i>`LIGHTS_ON_time`</i></b>.<p>You can also use the same timing if you are trying to combat oversleeping and want to push your internal circadian clock earlier in order to ease waking up in the morning.  Our time estimates provide only a general guideline.  Depending on your habitual sleep duration, you may have to wake up somewhat earlier than usual for greatest benefit.  In such cases, some people compensate with earlier bedtime, while others find no need to do so.</p><font size="-1">*This assumes treatment using a 10,000 lux fluorescent light box with overhead diffusing screen.
