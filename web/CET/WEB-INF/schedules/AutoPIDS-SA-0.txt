Intro	Intro		1	q		This online questionnaire may help you decide whether to consult a clinician about depression, whether Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) may be your problem, and whether treatment -- with light, medication, negative air ionization, or psychotherapy -- should be considered. This is not a method for self-diagnosis, but it can help you assess the severity and timing of certain symptoms of depression. You should answer these questions privately - for your personal use only.  You may want to discuss your results with your doctor or therapist, and you will be able to print out your feedback at the end.  If family members or friends also want to use the AutoPIDS-SA, please refer them to this website for separate personal sessions.	nothing

ReportA	ReportA		1	q		<b>Part 1. SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION.  Altogether, you marked `Ascore` problems</b>.	nothing
ReportA_gt_5	ReportA_gt_5		Ascore >= 5	q		Since you reported 5 or more problems, it is possible that you have had a major depressive disorder for which you should consider seeking help.  You may have experienced some of these problems for less than two weeks -- if so, your problem is probably not a "major" depressive disorder (as clinically defined), but still may be serious enough to merit consultation with a therapist, and possible treatment.	nothing
ReportA_lt_5	ReportA_lt_5		(Ascore > 0 && Ascore < 5)	q		Even if you marked only one or two problems, you may want to consult with a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other mental health professional if the problems worry you or interfere with your daily activities.	nothing

ReportB_lt_6	ReportB_lt_6		Bscore < 6	q		Since your total score is less than 6, you fall within the "nonseasonal" range.  You probably do not have seasonal affective disorder (SAD).  If your score on Part 1 was high, however, it is still possible that you have experienced a depression that merits the attention and guidance of a mental health professional.	nothing
ReportB_mid	ReportB_mid		(Bscore > 6 && Bscore < 12)	q		Since your score on falls between 7 and 11, you may have a mild version of SAD for which seasonal changes are noticeable, and possibly even quite bothersome, but are probably not overwhelmingly difficult.	nothing
ReportB_high	ReportB_high		(Bscore >=12)	q		Since your score is 12 or more, SAD that is clinically significant is increasingly likely. But you still need to consider which months pose most problems, as shown in Part 3.	nothing

ReportC3	ReportC3		1	q		<p>People with fall or winter depression tend to score 4 or more per month in a series of 3-5 months beginning anywhere from September to January, as would be noted in Column A. For months outside that grouping the score tends to be zero, or nearly zero. In Column B, the same people will usually score 4 or more points per month over a series of 3-5 months beginning anywhere from March to June. Some people show a different pattern, with scores split between Columns A and B during both winter and summer months. For example, they may feel worst and socialize least during the summer, especially July and August; during the same time period, they may eat least, lose most weight, and sleep least. In winter, they may feel best and socialize most, yet still tend to eat most, gain most weight, and sleep most. Such people may experience seasonal depression of the summer type, and treatment recommendations may well differ from those for winter depression. Some people show relatively high scores in the fall and winter months in Column A (winter depression), but there is still a remaining scatter of good and bad months throughout the year. Such a pattern may indicate a 'winter worsening' of symptoms, rather than clear-cut SAD. Recommendations for winter treatment might be similar to those for winter-SAD, although there may be a need for multiple treatment approaches. Some people experience depression in the winter as well as in the summer, but they feel fine in the spring and the fall. Their summer depression is usually not accompanied by oversleeping and overeating, in contrast with the winter. This is a special case of SAD, for which different treatments might be appropriate in the opposite seasons. Even people who experience only winter depression sometimes feel summertime slumps in mood and energy when the weather is rainy or dark for several days. They often find relief by brief use of their winter treatment during these periods.</p>	nothing
ReportD	ReportD		1	q		<b>Part 4.  SOME SPECIFIC PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSION.  Your score was `Dscore`</b>.	nothing
ReportD_gt_0	ReportD_gt_0		Dscore > 0	q		Since you reported some of these tendencies, you have experienced winter symptoms that may respond to light therapy and various medications, regardless of whether or not you have depressed mood. The higher your score in Part 4, the more likely you are to have 'classic' winter-SAD. It is possible, however, to be depressed in winter <i>without</i> these symptoms -- or even with <i>opposite</i> symptoms such as reduced sleep and appetite -- if so, a therapist might recommend a different treatment from that for 'classic' SAD.	nothing
