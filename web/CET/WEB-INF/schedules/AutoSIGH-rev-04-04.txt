If you are experiencing depression, you should see a mental health professional for diagnosis, advice and treatment. The AutoSIGH will ask you about all aspects of depression, both emotional and physical. The score provides a measure of overall severity based on your experiences over the past week. The AutoSIGH is anonymous and confidential. We provide your score online with explanation, ready for printout, but our web server cannot tie your information back to you.<p><b>The AutoSIGH will require about 10-20 minutes of your attention depending on how many symptoms you report are bothering you.

	young	young	age==0	q		Dear friend, you told us you are less than 13 years old. It's very tough to feel bad when you're a kid. You shouldn't have to feel this way. People feel bad for many different reasons -- like if someone is hurting them, or when they get sick. People can also feel bad when there seems to be absolutely no reason for it. That's why it is very important to tell someone you trust when you're feeling bad. They can help you understand what's happening. They can also help you find out how to feel better. Many people want to help you. They might be your parents, the parents of one of your friends, an aunt or uncle, your teacher, someone at your church or temple, or even a cop. The questions on our website are for <i>grownups</i> who feel bad, not for kids. It's more important for you now to <b>talk to someone about how you're feeling</b>. if you don't have anyone you can talk to, call the nice people at 1-800-273-8255 or 1-800-784-2433 and they will help you get the help you need. If you live outside the United States, you can find help by <A href="http://www.preventsuicidenow.com/suicide-hotlines-international.html" target="_blank"><b><u><i>click here</i></u></b></A>.

In general, scores below 4 indicate normal, "OK" mood (or even high mood). <b>When we talk about levels of depression as mild, moderate or severe, there are no exact score cutoffs. The dividing lines are fuzzy, and require a clinician's interpretation taking into account each person's history and symptom pattern</b>. Scores between 4 and 10 suggest minimal symptomatology, which any individual might show occasionally. But if your score remains between 4 and 10 for several weeks, the problems merit attention. Scores above 10 suggest levels of depression that should be monitored closely if <b>mild</b> (11 to 15), but dealt with clinically if <b>moderate</b> (16 to 24) or <b>severe</b> (25 and above).	nothing
