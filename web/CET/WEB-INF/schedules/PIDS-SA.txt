Intro	Intro		1	]		This questionnaire may help you decide whether to consult a clinician about depression, whether Seasonal Affecteive Disorder (SAD) may be your problem, and whether treatment -- with light, medication, or psychotherapy -- should be considered.  This is not a method for self-diagnosis, but it can help you assess the severity and timing of certain symptoms of depression.  You should answer these questions privately -- for your personal use -- and make separate copies of the questionnaire if family members or friends want to use it.	nothing

ReportA	ReportA		1	[		<b>Part 1.</b>  You marked `Ascore` problems.  If you reported 5 or more problems, it is possible that you have had a major depressive disorder for which you should consider seeking help.  Even if you marked only one or two problems, you may want to consult with a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or other mental health professional if the problems worry you or interfere with your daily activities.  You may have experienced some of these problems for <i>less</i> than two weeks -- if so, your problem is probably not a "major" depressive disorder (as clinically defined), but still may be serious enough to merit consultation with a therapist, and possible treatment.  To determine whether the problem might be seasonal, consider Parts 2 and 3 below.	nothing
ReportB	ReportB		1	q		<b>Part 2.</b>  Your total score was `Bscore`.  If your total score is less than 6, you fall within the "nonseasonal" range.

ReportD	ReportD		1	]		<b>Part 4.</b>  Your score was `Dscore`.  If you reported any of these specific behaviors, you have experienced winter symptoms that may respond to treatments for SAD, regardless of whether or not you have depressed mood.  The higher your score in Part 4, the more likely you are to have winter SAD.  It is possible, however, to be depressed in winter <i>without</i> these symtpoms -- or even with <i>opposite</i> symtpoms such as reduced sleep and appetite.  If so, a mental health professional might recommend a treatment not designed specifically for SAD.	nothing
