Intro2	Intro2		(_ask==1)	q		Below you will find a series of 19 questions about your daily sleep-wake habits and the times of day that you prefer to perform certain activities.  This questionnaire should take about 5-10 minutes.  After answering all the questions, you will receive the following feedback:<ol><li>your morningness-eveningness score</li><li>your "type" relative to other people</li><li>an estimate of when your brain starts to produce the hormone melatonin in the evening or at night</li><li>an estimate of your "natural bedtime" as guided by your internal body clock, and</li><li>an estimate of the optimum morning interval to use bright light therapy if you are suffering from winter depression (seasonal affective disorder).</li></ol>You should use this questionnaire only if your preferred bedtime falls between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m., and your preferred wake-up time falls between 5 a.m. and 12 noon.  This questionnaire is not suitable for people with major sleep-wake disorders and those who normally sleep outside of the specified range. <br /> <br />For each question, please select the answer that best describes you.  Make your judgments based on how you have felt in recent weeks. <br /> <br />As soon as you complete the questionnaire, you will receive screen feedback with your results, and you will also be able to print out your answers to all the questions. <br /> <br />	nothing
