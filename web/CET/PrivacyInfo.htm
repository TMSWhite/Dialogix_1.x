<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ADVISORY INFORMATION<BR>
Ways to protect your privacy on the Internet</B></P>
<P><BR>
The Internet allows us to access health information conveniently, but we should also be aware of the risks. Increasingly,
websites attempt to find out as much information as they can about those who visit, even compiling personal profiles
based on information gathered from different sites. <I>We emphasize that our website does no such thing, and visitors
remain anonymous to us. </I><BR>
<BR>
Personal information gained this way often has commercial value and is sometimes sold or given to third parties
in commercial transactions or as part of partnership agreements. Furthermore, even if a website maintains good
privacy policies, the volatile nature of online businesses - which frequently involves bankruptcies, mergers and
acquisitions - leaves the possibility that if a business is purchased, the new owner can obtain personal information
without the obligation to maintain the previous owner's privacy policies. <I>We emphasize that our website is noncommercial,
and visitors here are not vulnerable to such intrusions.</I><BR>
<BR>
Another disturbing factor is that more than 34% of employers currently monitor employees' e-mail and web browsing.
Employers are not obligated to notify employees about such monitoring. Tracking software usually records the Internet
sites you visit, your bookmarks, e-mail addresses, and sometimes even keystrokes you make to the keyboard. If you
are concerned about possible monitoring at work by your employer, we recommend that you use other Internet facilities,
such as at public libraries (which offer free access), internet cafes, copy centers (for example, Kinko's), or
home on your own computer.<BR>
<BR>
In view of the sensitive, personal nature of much medical browsing - including mental-health browsing - we offer
following information and suggestions to help you safeguard your privacy:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cookies</B><BR>
Cookies are small text files that websites may attempt to store on your computer; they work to analyze which site
features you use most, where you visit, etc. There are two types of cookie: session cookies, which last only for
the duration of the user's visit or for a limited amount of time and are then self-erased, and persistent cookies,
which are permanent and must be deleted manually. Some cookies have expiration dates as long as 10 or 15 years
in the future. By using cookies and large databases in conjunction with information gathered from other sites,
website owners may be able to profile you or determine your identity.<BR>
<BR>
Your browser can be set to accept all cookies, warn you before accepting them and give you the choice of rejecting
them, or automatically reject all cookies. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Anonymizers</B><BR>
Several commercial sites provide the service of &quot;hiding&quot; your visits to other sites, preventing tracking
by a third party. Generally one has to go to these sites first and conduct any Internet activity from there. When
you type in the site address you want, you are forwarded to that site, but traceable information about you is hidden.
Two of the most popular anonymizers are Anonymizer.com and Safeweb.com. Note that these services themselves can
detect where you went, so you must decide whether you trust them to safeguard your information. There are also
free software packages, such as AdSubtract, which can be used to block advertising and cookies.<BR>
<BR>
The Freedom software package (http://www.freedom.net) provides the most comprehensive privacy protection available.
This is a special suite of privacy protection tools, which gives you the ability to create nyms (stand-in names)
with which you browse. You can accept cookies, perform transactions, etc., while not revealing your identity. The
whole process is encrypted by a network of special servers that can only detect where a packet came from and the
next server to which it is going, but cannot detect the ultimate destination of your browsing. Thus, even the Freedom
Company (ZeroKnowledge.com) has no access to your personal information or browsing history.<BR>
<BR>
In offering you this detailed information, we are not urging you to take any unusual steps to hide your identity
on the Internet unless you see a definite need to do so for personal reasons. Again, we emphasize that our website
collects no personal information from its visitors and is completely independent of other health sites you may
visit, including those which may have referred you to us. We hope you find this background valuable and supportive
of your efforts to seek authoritative medical information on the Web.
