<P><STRONG>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</STRONG>: You are being asked to participate in a study about the stability of personality from
childhood to adulthood, and how it is related to adult functioning.</P>
<P><STRONG>ALTERNATIVE TO STUDY PARTICIPATION</STRONG>: This is not a treatment protocol.  Information is being collected for
research purposes only.</P>
<P><STRONG>STUDY PROCEDURES</STRONG>:  You may answer our questions on the web, by telephone, or by mail.  You will be asked
about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and about your work, school, family, and social relationships, since
the last time you were interviewed seven years ago.  This web-based portion will take about 11/2 hours.  Additional
material will be sent by mail, including consent forms to sign and return.</P>
<P><STRONG>RISKS AND BENEFITS</STRONG>: In the experience of the research investigators, this study has no risk to you.  This
information is collected for research purposes and not for your benefit.  However, the results of the research may
contribute to scientific knowledge in the future.</P>
<P><STRONG>COMPENSATION</STRONG>: This study is being conducted with joint funding.  You will receive one money order for $100 in
the mail for your participation; this payment includes $50 from us and the $50 payment noted in the Mount Sinai
consent you will be given to sign.  It may take two to four weeks to receive the money order.</P>
<P><STRONG>RESEARCH STANDARDS AND RIGHTS:</STRONG> Your participation is voluntary.  You can refuse to participate or
discontinue participation at any time without loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  You also will be
notified of significant new findings that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate.  We will take the
following steps to keep the information confidential.  All information will be coded and your name will never be
connected to your responses.  Records and all other research materials will be kept in locked files and will be
available only to research staff and institutional personnel as part of routine audits.  It is particularly important for
you to know that we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the United States Government for this study
to make sure we can best protect your privacy.  This certificate means that the researchers cannot be forced to tell
people who are not connected with the study about your participation unless you request disclosure.  This includes
courts and the police.  There are some limits to the researchers' ability to maintain your confidentiality.  If we learn
keeping information private would immediately put you in danger, or put in danger someone else we know about,
then we will have to tell the appropriate agencies to protect you or another person.  </P>
<P>The investigators will answer any questions about the study described above.  If you have any further questions
you may call Dr. Cohen or Dr. Kasen at (212) 740-1460.  Recruitment of subjects for this research study has been
evaluated and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University - New York State Psychiatric
Institute.  If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, or any complaints, you may call the
