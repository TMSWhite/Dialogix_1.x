homepage.title=A Model 2 JSP Application
homepage.text=<p>This mockup of a fruit stand uses many of the techniques discussed in Advanced JavaServer Pages, published by Sun Microsystems Press and Prentice-Hall in May 2001. That book discusses a simple Model 2 Web application framework that's the basis for this application. The purpose of this aplication is to illustrate using the book's techniques to develop a nontrivial web application.</p><p>This web application is internationalized in three languages: English, German, and Chinese. By default, this application uses the browser's language preferences to decide which language to use, but you can also explicitly set the language by clicking on one of the flags in the sidebar. Try it now, if you like.<i> Note: your browser must support Chinese fonts to see the Chinese translations. See your browser's website for more information concerning that support.</i></p><p>JSP templates are used extensively throughout this web application to construct web pages. Every web page in this application was created with a JSP template, which lets those pages share components; for example, the text "Welcome to Fruitstand.com" and the horizontal rule underneath it are created by a JSP file that is reused by every web page in this application. JSP templates encapsulate page layout and encourage the use of reusable components.</p><p>This web application uses programmatic authentication--meaning authentication implemented from scratch--to ensure portability. The authentication forces users to login before they can check out their purchase. If a user doesn't have an account, they are given the opportunity to create one and subsequently login. Programmatic authentication, as opposed to BASIC or DIGEST authentication, gives applications complete control over authentication because it takes the servlet container out of the authentication loop.</p><p>Many other techniques from Advanced JavaServer Pages are used in this web application; for example, a form framework is used to handle HTML forms and custom tags are used to detect sensitive form resubmissions. This application also uses many of the book's other JSP custom tags.</p><p>To get started, click the Go Shopping button in the sidebar.</p><p>
