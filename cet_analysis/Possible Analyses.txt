-Seasonality within women occurs in early 30s with attenuation as get older (by age 60, see less of it) - 
-80% of people with SAD are women -- can test selection bias
-Winter seasonality more prevalent at higher latitudes - internal validation
-Latitude clines of seasonal vs. not (as % of sample size) [see PPT & repeat]

-Use Latitude cline by seasonal type and slice by gender & age
-Correlation coefficients with actual latitude info

*Sleep duration - hypersomnia greater in the north?  What is relationship between hypersomnia and SAD?  Distinguishing it from sadness
	distinguish night length from amount of sleep - want to see stronger association between hypersomnia in north with winter depression
	than in the south; and must do this winter vs. summer (since population as a whole sleeps longer in winter)
	Average weighted sleep duration (just within winter) within Subjects with SAD vs Latitude -- if stronger correlation with SAD than with latitude, then suggesgts that hypersomnia associated with SAD, not night length
	
What variables are needed for this?  sduravg, lat_good, season, MajorDepression_dx, MinorDepression_dx
	
*What is relationship between sleep duration and SAD vs. SAN (how closely is hypersomnia associated with depression vs. seasonality / 

-Urban vs. rural
(1) amount of time in direct sunlight
(2) incidence of diagnosis (SAD vs SANS distribution)
(3) plotting the data we have - ability to filter by age, etc.

Mapping - compare our data to census	

Action Items
[2]How many people referred to Kripke (Feedback7a)
[ ]Data preparation for avg sleep duration during winter (should be OK - just sub-select and then correlation?)
[ ]Updating data for the latitude clines
[-]George Musa about geo-plotting - might know climatic breakdowns (rainy season)

GIS
Climatic variables and SAD?  Rainfall, Snowfall, Cloudcover, # of hours with sunshine (Seattle group), Barometric pressure
Urban vs. Rural
Elevation
Face Validity - features of respondants vs. our sample

---
What questions for May 15th?
(1) Latitude cline of XX sliced by gender and age - show as rates per 100,000?
(2) Hours of sunshine on average over last 5 years vs. Latitude (from station data)
(3) Compare our data to zip?
