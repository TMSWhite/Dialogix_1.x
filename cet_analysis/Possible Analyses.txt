

Theories:

-Seasonality within women occurs in early 30s with attenuation as get older (by age 60, see less of it) - 
-80% of people with SAD are women -- can test selection bias
-Winter seasonality more prevalent at higher latitudes - internal validation
-Latitude clines of seasonal vs. not (as % of sample size) [see PPT & repeat]

-Use Latitude cline by seasonal type and slice by gender & age
-Correlation coefficients with actual latitude info

*Sleep duration - hypersomnia greater in the north?  What is relationship between hypersomnia and SAD?  Distinguishing it from sadness
	distinguish night length from amount of sleep - want to see stronger association between hypersomnia in north with winter depression
	than in the south; and must do this winter vs. summer (since population as a whole sleeps longer in winter)
	Average weighted sleep duration (just within winter) within Subjects with SAD vs Latitude -- if stronger correlation with SAD than with latitude, then suggesgts that hypersomnia associated with SAD, not night length
	
What variables are needed for this?  sduravg, lat_good, season, MajorDepression_dx, MinorDepression_dx

(1) is depression more strongly correlated with depression or latitude - stepwise linear regression

(2) Latitude cline at two different longitudes - (west, midwest/south, east)

Notes from Terman from 3/5 - 3/11
-----------------------------------
George,

Let's continue this discussion in person before deciding what info we  
need.

Meanwhile, Tom and I met last Friday and reoriented the theme of our  
abstract (doc attached).  We were able to find that symptoms are  
worse the farther west you go in the Eastern time zone, then suddenly  
improve when you cross the time zone.  (The topic is related to the  
current debate about extending daylight saving time, and was  
suggested to us by David Avery of Univ. of Washington.) I've drafted  
an abstract (attached), which we all need to review and discuss by  
the end of the week.  We would be delighted to include you as an  
author if you can make the commitment to work up map-based graphics  
(subject distribution, longitude and latitude effects, separately and  
in combination, perhaps stratified by MEQ score).  Tom is continuing  
to examine related effects.

/Michael 

Tom,

You probably realized this already, but just in case...

To refine the longitude criteria I suggested yesterday: we cannot literally
use -87.5 deg longitude as the divider between eastern and central time,
since that only approximates the IN and IL borders (which we need to
retain). I think all the other latitude and longitude criteria are OK.
Right?

/Michael

Still needs very careful review (primarily yours).  Numbers to be adjusted
given revised map coordinates.

George should be an author only if we are assured of a meaningful
contribution.

Will hold off showing this to Avery till you and I finalize.

/M 

Tom,

I've been staring at the map.

I think it would be cleanest for us to define equivalent latitude and
longitude ranges for our comparisons, disregarding state lines.

For example, 6-deg ranges seem to catch all our current major urban areas.

LAT/LONG DIVISIONS in 6-deg bins:

Northeast tier of EST: lat 39-45 deg, long 69-75 deg

Northwest tier of EST: lat 39-45 deg, long 81.5-87.5 deg

Northeast tier of CST: lat 39-45 deg, long 87.5-93.5

There are actually 4 time zones (not 3!), EST, CST, MST and PST.  The
Pacific range (total 6 deg longitude) is too narrow to define a
within-time-zone gradient (it includes only WA and OR in the north), and the
high symptomatology there is probably a pure latitude effect, since both
Portland and Seattle both lie above 45 deg N. The Pacific data would be
great for the latitude analyses, but not for the time zone analyses.

Agreed?

If you can possible redefine the 3 relevant groups and grind out the data, I
think our abstract would be clearer.

Possible to do quickly?  If not, I'll use the present numbers.

/Michael

Tom,

Dave Avery wrote that he is very pleased to join us, but not as an author or
investigator with primary responsibility.  Good -- what we need him for is
the Introduction and Discussion sections....

It occurs to me that our within-time-zone effect should be modulated by MEQ
score, although I'm not sure how.  The late risers will miss the dawn
anyway, so location might not make a difference for them.  On the other
hand, MEQ score might actually decrease while moving west within a time
zone, since delayed dawn could encourage circadian delay drift.

Can we check for such MEQ effects, both latitudinally and longitudinally?

Possibly we can find an MEQ subgroup that is particularly hard hit (in terms
of B score, winter MDD, atypical vegetative symptoms, and wake-up time*) by
either or both factors.

We didn't look at this, but it would be nice to see if the western subgroup
wakes up later, either on average for the whole week or work days vs. rest
days.

If there is an MEQ effect, it would be great to mention in the abstract,
which I am starting to draft.

/Michael

Dave,

Inspired by your notes of the past few days, I sat down with Tom White
MD, medical informatics director at NYS Office of Mental Health, who
devised our on-line questionnaires at www.cet.org, for which we have
thousands of respondents from all over the country.

So . . .

we said seasonality and SAD should be worse the farther west you go in
any time zone, since sunrise is later, and should get better as soon as
you cross to the next time zone.  We have 4 regions with sufficient
sample size: northeast coast, northwest tier of eastern time zone (MI,
OH, IN), northeast tier of central time zone (WI, IL) and northwest
coast (WA, OR).

The results are large, significant and unambiguous:  Higher global
seasonality scores, higher prevalence of SAD (MDD criteria), more
severe atypical symptoms (fatigue, hypersomnia, weight gain) in both
northwest tiers compared with northeast tiers.

For example, winter seasonal MDD

northeast tiers combined, 24.5% of 1160 respondents
northwest tiers combined, 30.2% of 758 respondents

chi-sq = 7.44, df = 1, p = .006

Similar results when the 4 regions are separated.

This is very exciting.  We want to make a SLTBR abstract out of it, and
for you to join as an author if you would contribute to an expanded
paper on the subject.  We're giving the raw data to our geographic
statistician, who will look more closely and possibly add a latitude
factor.  If this works out, possibly we have the basis for a Science
paper (innovative, topical, public health impact) that would argue
against expanding daylight saving time.  Let us both know your
impressions.

/Michael

Recent discussion with colleagues about SAD-exacerbating implication  
of extending daylight saving time (with less morning light before and  
after the winter episode).  Point was made that even under standard  
time, those living at the western edge of any time zone (probably  
most obvious in our eastern zone) have a ~1-h delay in sunrise  
relative to the eastern edge. If so, there might be a longitudinal  
cline in seasonality (B score) or SAD (A+B+C score criteria) that we  
could detect in our data.  It might be concentrated higher latitudes  
(latitude/longitude interaction within time zones).  That would be a  
spectacular finding, and could contribute to the current federal  
debate on extending daylight saving time, since people vulnerable to  
SAD would experience a ~2h delay in sunrise if they live in the  
western tier of a time zone.  Think we can explore for such a  
relationship?

See you later.
