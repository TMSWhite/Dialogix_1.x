web applications.

          parent 
  (application embeding tomcat - 
  visible in container and web apps)
           |
           |
         common 
     ( files in lib/common - 
  visible in container and web apps)
   |			       |
   |			       |
container		     shared
( files in lib )	       |
(XXX move to		       |
