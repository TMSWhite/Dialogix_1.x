	<LI>Node(?) : Patient State, Decision Point, Action Alternatives (displayed as disorganized graph)
	<LI>Web-based display of guideline goal, primary recommendation, patient summary (HTN info - what they are on -
	for clinical revelance), and secondary recommendations. Gives the reasons too (links as to explanation why)
	<LI>Also lists potential relative contraindicaitons
	<LI>More-Info button - e.g. advisories about changing medication
	<LI>Can enter different data to see what happens (rather than pull directly from database)
	<LI>Uses color highlighting to mark severity / emergency
	<LI>How are they pulling in information about drugs?
	<LI>Tab showing assumptions from which decision is made - can change these assumptions
	<LI>** Clinicians like chronological display of drug vs. BP - (could this be done as an &quot;info-button&quot;
	- since related to the evidence, could show which evidence is clinically relevant?)
	<LI>Allows for local customization (e.g. formulary, drug knowledge base)
	<LI>** Does not include information on managing secondary hypertension or exceptions related to pregnancy (so not
	complete)
	<LI>** Knowledge base standards? - 300 frames &amp; 300 rules (in Protege knowlege base).
	<LI>Guideline Model used at Stanford is not fully standardized - which are they using? What is the current status?
	What is it called? (EON?)
