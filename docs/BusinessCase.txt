TRICEPS Project

Business Case

What is it?
Triceps is a World-Wide Web-based software system for rapidly designing, deploying, and analyzing complex surveys and structured interviews.  In particular it:
1.allows interview schedule definition or modification
2.performs interviews
3.reports interview results
4.instantiates a generalizable model of inquiry

Why is it useful?
1.can be deployed for data collection in many ways
2.connects interview questions and answers with standard vocabulary and concepts
3.works for any interview language
4.permits dynamic, personalized interviews
5.permits data storage flexibility both in format and location

What problem(s) does it solve?
1.the speed of interview development
2.the cost of system code modification
3.unreferenced data and questions
4.the standardization of terms and concepts
5.the integration with other systems
6.interview tailoring, i.e., shaping a interview in the light of previous responses
7.the confusion of content with presentation
8.deployment limitations
9.the need for data isolation

What are its advantages?
1.simple, compact, and fast
2.domain independent (e.g., useful in medicine or marketing)
3.permits independent control of standardized concepts, questions, and their data
4.easy to use
5.questions and data are clearly referenced by a standard concept or vocabulary
6.permits personalized questions
7.built to use the internet for distributed deployment and data storage
8.supports display and media variations
9.supports multiple users
10.platform independent
11.not limited to pre-defined question or answer types
12.data persistence is not bound to any particular storage system

What is novel about it?
1.its underlying theoretical model
2.possesses advanced iteration logic
3.applicable in multiple domains
4.dynamic question formation, tailoring
5.action flexibility
6.explicit integration of standard terms and concepts at each step in the interview
7.separates content and logic of the interview from its presentation
8.able to interpret and execute actions defined in the schedule (external to the system)

Who will use it?
1.interviewers collecting data in face-to-face structured interviews
2.enterprises collecting data in web-based interviews
3.educators developing curricula, teaching courses, and giving tests
4.researchers developing and deploying measurement instruments
5.clinicians needing a customized data collection tool
6.students organizing material being studied
7.domain specialists developing improved concept and relation typologies

What is the closest prior state of the art?
1.systems to define, deliver, and score simple, static interviews
2.systems to define, deliver, and score educational programs (Socratease)
3.domain-specific systems to deploy, score, and report complicated interviews (C-CISC, JADE)
4.
