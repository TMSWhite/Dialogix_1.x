Church's Thesis
	Computer programs are not provable - can disprove this
Standard View
	Computerized diagnostic systems can't ever be really good
	limitations on main-machine interface
	limitations on Knowledge representation
Standard of Care
	"community standard"
	"reasonable person" - practitioner
	to adhere to standard of care
	reduce risk
	does a KDss decrease error rate?
		correct diagnosis does not imply correct treatment
		inaccurate diagnosis does not imply incorrect treatment
		often unassessed
Appropriate use / users
	users - DxPlain
	use - training, context
	unintended purpose - using med school training tool in clinical practice
	professional relationships - shared decision support
Legal Issues
	malpractice
		duty to treat
		deviation from standard of care
		harm must occur (so good outcome seldom leads to lawsuits)
		harm causally related to deviation from standard of care
	Clinical Decision Support Systems
		decreased error rate leads to decreased malpractice
		may increase standard of care - so hospitals can be sued if they don't have a CDSS
	Purpose of CDSS
		if economic, and something bad happens, than increase liability
	Textbook model - disclaimer
		open-loop decision support system
	Ownership/royalties
		[Knowledge transfer]
		what about author of knowledge that is sold elsewhere
Regulatory Issues
	RISK
		potential for harm
		degree of oversight - e.g. closed loop systems are inherently more risky
	FDA Cosmetic Act of 1984
		"medical device" -> contrivance
			dx, tx, mitigate dx, affect structure or function
		Class I - exempt
		Class II - relatively low risk (501K approval)
		Class III - pre-marketing level approval.  AND, any time changed, has to be re-approved.
	Classes of Decision Support Systems
		(1) Educational:  textbook [exempt]
			non-patient specific
		(2) Component of a device:  - like a chip on a pacemaker
		(3) Accessories that are attached to or inform an already regulated clinical system - PACS, Blood Bank, Gamma-Ray planning
		(4) Stand-alone software
	Low Risk
	Intermediate - guideline - probable dx, proposed treatment
	Risk increases with degree of patient specificity
	
Evaluation
	When?
		Equipoise
			when there is a fundamental unceratainty as to which of two systems is best
			If can prove one better, failure to use would be unethical
	Why?
		Improvement
			publication
			liability / ethics
			Cost
			Outcomes
				process
				speed
				preventative
			Liability
			System improvement
			Safety
			CYA [what is this?]
	What?
		Structure
		UI
		Vocabulary
		KB
		Inference Mechanism
	How?
		Function
			compared to gold standard - know best answer
			silver standard - when there are several possible good answers - as assessed by a group of experts
			Other standards - Functional specification via panel of experts
				Round Robin - set of cases sent to panel of experts - consensus
				Majority Voting - all see all cases - ballots for best answer
		Clinical Outcomes
			relatively few look at this
		Efficacy
			has desired effect in isolation (lab setting)
		Effectiveness
			has desired effect in the real-world
			
	Methodology
		Randomized Clinical Trial
			Prospective
				Unit of analysis:  MD?  Patient?  Office/Clinic?
				Blinding
			Retrospective
				Case Control
		Critical Incident
			open ended questions about disasters
			responses classified into groups
			matrix
		Survey
		Meta-Analysis
		On-Off (pseudo correlational)
		
	Woahs!
		Biases
			Hawthorne - being observed
			Check-list effect - organizing info in a questionnaire might impact knowledge
			Carry-over bias - output in intervention arm of study will affect the control group
			Feedback
			Secular Trend - if affects standard of care, might be world changes
			System Change - e.g. to knowledge base
			
Midterm Exam Info
	KB separate from Inference Engine makes maintainability easier
	Production rules - unable to do things in sequence.
