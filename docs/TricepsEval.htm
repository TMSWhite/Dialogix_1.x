<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Evaluating Triceps</FONT></B></P>
<P>It would be nice to ask questions that will let us easily address how Triceps fares in terms of existing theories
and best practices.  One of the drawbacks of the Schneiderman questionnaire is that it focuses on presentation
issues that will ultimately be under the author's control, rather than Triceps'.  For example, do we really care
whether the fonts were easy to read and many of the questions under your <I>Screen</I> section.  Also, we haven't
authored the <I>Help</I> section, so we don't know how it will appear.  Would it be silly to ask questions about
issues we didn't plan to change?</P>

<P>It would also be helpful to make several questionnaires based upon the roles with which different users will
interact with Triceps.  For example:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Authors

			<LI>what input styles are best for different datatypes
			<UL>
				<LI>style - radio, radio2, combo, list
				<LI>size - should list boxes be limited to a certain number of entries, or should all be shown?
			</UL>
		</UL>
		<LI>expectations
		<UL>
			<LI>did the system ever surprise you - did something unexpected (gulf of execution, evalution, astonishment)
		</UL>
	</UL>
	<LI>General comments

		<LI>what did you most dislike?

<P><B>Below is a summary of notes I culled from Schneiderman, Justin's course, and Stephen's Intro course.  We
