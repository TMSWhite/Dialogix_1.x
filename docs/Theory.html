<P ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;We are drowning in information and starved for
knowledge.&quot; -- Unknown</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;Properly, there is no other knowledge than that
which is got by working, the rest is all yet a hypothesis of

<H2>Background theoretical model - informal specification.</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">TRICEPS is a computational system
designed in accordance with a model of inquiry/reasoning to generate
new knowledge.</P>
<H3>Knowledge</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Knowledge, in general, is a systematic
interaction of perception, association, and action. In most settings
it occurs without any component of that rarest of elements, reason or
inquiry, but is nonetheless visible in both the simplest reflex and
the most complex system when, on the occasion of a discrete input, is
there appears an associated output.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">What does a basic traffic light know?
It knows to turn from green to amber, amber to red, and red to green.
It perceives only input from its timers. It makes only three
associations. It behaves only by turning its lights on and off. It
cannot learn to behave differently. It cannot conceive a new pattern
of association. It cannot respond to anything besides the timer
trigger.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Knowledge, in most settings, resides in
a knower either by construction or imposition. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Alarm clocks know to ring at the
appointed time because we set them to do so. Radar systems know to
report the position of aircraft because someone built them that way.
We know (can report) the value of pi, the latest box scores, or the
neighbor's name by being told. We know how to tie our shoes by
mimicry and repetition. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The limits of a system's ability to
perceive, to associate, or to act and the limits of its ability to
coordinate these activities, constitute the limits on its ability to
know.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In what sense, then, can knowledge be
given or acquired? Knowledge can be built in. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P>Knowledge, however obtained and within whatever limits, is
demonstrable. That is, it is proveable, testable, validatable,
measurable. It is not enough to point to a particular form, for
example, the diagnostic criteria for major depression in DSM-IV, and
say that is an example of psychiatric knowledge. It is at most a
residue of knowledge and possibly a participant in knowledge. So when
that information is part of a demonstrable behavior, say, in a
psychiatrist making a diagnosis or in a resident passing the
psychiatry boards, one recognizes knowledge. In knowledge,
information is applied on an occasion where it is involved in the
actual relationship between the knower and the thing known.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">This restriction of the term knowledge
is at odds with a good portion of its common usage where, for
example, knowledge resides in books and knowledge is acquired and
represented in the most diverse and inexact means. These &quot;hypotheses
of knowledge&quot; however, are better not confused with occasions of
knowledge. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Knowledge, as we consider it here,
occurs in the application by a system of a particular mapping of
three basic components, i.e., a perceived datum, an association
(e.g., concept), and an action. It may result, on occasion, from a
motivation to act in relation to a substance, object, or entity. If
this mapping is not already stored in memory (known) then other known
mappings and the execution of their specified actions are used to
generate a new mapping. It is reference to and use of this mapping
that achieves the transition from inquiring/reasoning state (of
doubt) to a resolved state (of belief) in an inquirer/reasoner on
occasions of knowing. This mapping is the particular way that a
knower relates to the thing known in a particular context, or on a
particular occasion. Knowledge, so specified, can be characterized as
to its time, place, validity, complexity, accuracy, redundancy,
ambiguity, scope, knower, and subject. Information is a term that
best refers to those expressions that are processible in knowledgable
systems.</P>
<H3>Inquiry/Reasoning</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inquiry/Reasoning is the process of
finding out, on the basis of what is already known, something else
which is not known. It is performed by an inquirer/reasoner, on an
occasion in which the inquirer/reasoner is motivated to address a
problem, question, or doubt, about a specified substance, object, or
entity (about which something may presumably be known), and results
in either the establishment of a new, or the confirmation of a
previous, disposition to behave in a particular way on similar
occasions. The basic elements of inquiry/reasoning, then, are:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">Suppose a psychiatrist, already
well-versed in the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV, is asked the
question, &quot;Does the child Jean have ADHD?&quot; Based on what
the inquirer/reasoner already knows, she will procede to discover,
through appropriate investigation, whether Jean has the findings that
justify diagnosing ADHD. If asked the question again, the
psychiatrist (unless a doubt arises about whether a change may have
occured in Jean in the meantime) need not repeat the whole
investigation but simply report the results previously discovered.</P>
<H3>Inquirer/Reasoner</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An inquirer/reasoner, as the agent in
the above process, is either motivated to find something out (that
is, in a state of doubt, inquiring/reasoning) or is already disposed
to behave in a particular way (that is, already knows, is in a state
of certainty or belief). In terms of the example above, if the
psychiatrist does not know the answer, she knows how to go about
finding it. The role played by an/reasoner requires that several
processes and constructs be in place. The following are the most
fundamental of these:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Motivation: There must be a
	mechanism to motivate the inquirer/reasoner, that is, to place the
	inquirer/reasoner in a state of doubt from which there is an
	energeticstruggle to be freed (in the event that the
	inquirer/reasoner does not know what to do or is not disposed to act
	as the occasion requires). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Interaction: There must be a means
	for the inquirer/reasoner to develop, store, and access mechanisms
	of interaction with the object of inquiry/reasoning, the thing itis
	supposed to know or in reference to which it must behave in a
	particular way. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Conception: The inquirer/reasoner
	must have the means to develop, store, and access internal
	differentiae that (presumably) correspond to real and detectable
	differences in the object of knowledge. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Episodic Memory: There must be a
	means of storing and accessing the separate episodes or events of
	interaction with any object of knowledge, both internal and external
	to the inquirer/reasoner. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Resolution: There must be a mechanism to resolve the doubt
	and to mark the transition out of the state of doubt. 
	</P>
</OL>
<H3>Object of inquiry/reasoning</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A substance, object, or entity stands
in a relationship with an inquirer/reasoner, at the very least, such
that a real difference in its nature may correspond to a particular
difference in the way an inquirer/reasoner is disposed to act towards
it. The product of an inquiry/reasoning, whatever logical compulsion
or practical necessity may have produced it, is valid just insofar as
it reflects that correspondence. Incongruities in the relationship
between what an inquirer/reasoner &quot;knows&quot; about an object
and the actual characteristics of the object account for the fancies,
redundancies, and ambiguities of our thinking. Incompleteness in that
relationship is composed of both ignorance of what might possibly be
known and whatever inherent limitations there might be on the
possibilities of knowing at all under the circumstances. In terms of
the above example, the primary object of inquiry/reasoning is Jean
and whether or not she has ADHD. Of course, reference will be made,
in the process of this inquiry/reasoning, to many other related
objects, like diagnostic criteria and symptoms, that are either
already known or will have to be found out, in order to resolve the
main problem. It should be noted that the objects /reasoning are in
many instances (and above a certain level of complexity, in most)
internal to the inquiring/reasoning system, that is, elements of
varying complexity stored in the inquirer/reasoner's own memory. It
should also be noted that the source of the motivation, in the
example, Jean's mother, must be something about which sufficient
knowledge has been obtained so that the motivation makes sense.</P>
<H3>Inquiring/Reasoning and Resolved States</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When motivated on a particular occasion
by a particular problem, question, or doubt, an inquirer/reasoner
assumes a discrete, active state (a state of doubt or uncertainty)
the primary aim of which is to resolve the issue and resume its
resting state. A common product marking this transition is the
equivalent of &quot;I don't know.&quot; The subsequent &quot;knowledge&quot;
the inquirer/reasoner has of the object, on the occasion of a similar
motivation, is a certain, resolute ignorance from which she will be
moved only with effort. On the other hand, there may be a more useful
outcome of the process of inquiry/reasoning which will then mark the
transition to a resting state. This latter state, accomplished with a
useful outcome or not, unlike the active struggling of the
inquiring/reasoning state, is quietly content to simply reproduce
that outcome when the issue arises again. Returning to the above
example, the psychiatrist, motivated by the question about Jean, who
she does not know, is moved to a state of active inquiry/reasoning
until she can resolve the issue by answering yes, no, or that she
cannot find out at this time.</P>
<H3>Occasion</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An occasion, in general, is the
scenario or context in which a problem is presented to an/reasoning
agent to interact with respect to a substance, object, or entity in a
particular way. If the agent is already disposed to act in a
particular way on such occasions, that is, &quot;knows&quot; what to
do or knows the answer, the necessary action ensues and the occasion
is complete. If the agent does not know what to do, it may simply do
nothing, it may be constructed in such a way as to report to the
requesting entity that it doesn't know, or it may be an
inquiring/reasoning agent to which the problem becomes a motivation
to inquire and search for an answer. In the latter case, the
inquiry/reasoning might proceed (subject to some internal or external
termination criteria), to discover new knowledge, that is, to
discover an effective way to act on such occasions. The occasion, in
the example above, is the scenario in which a psychiatrist, a parent
or caregiver, and a child are related in such a way that a question
about the child's condition might meaningfully arise and be posed to
the psychiatrist by the parent about the child.</P>
<H3>Motivation</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The motivation to inquiry/reasoning is
the immediate trigger of the inquiring/reasoning or doubtful state.
The occasion presents it in the form of an event that the
inquirer/reasoner either cannot fully recognize or in respect to
which does not know how to behave. It is often in the form of an
expression commonly referred to as a problem, question, or doubt.
Whatever the form, however, a motivation must contain elements that
correspond to components of an extant knowledge mapping (see below)
and at least one element (in the event that there is no mapping) that
refers to the possible solution, the conclusion to be inferred, the
unknown value. In the example above, the motivation to
inquiry/reasoning is the question about Jean and ADHD. The answer to
this question is not a matter of simple recall, a thing the
psychiatrist knows as she must know the diagnostic criteria for ADHD.
But it contains references to both known concepts (e.g., ADHD) and to
unknown (e.g., Jean has ADHD) and so stimulates our psychiatrist into
a state of inquiry/reasoning to find it out.</P>
<H3>Basis for inquiry/reasoning</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The basis for inquiry/reasoning (a
knowledge base) is a system for the storage and retrieval of things
already known. Knowledge includes both mappings of simple facts and
mappings of rules that relate known things in such a way that a new
thing might be known. These rules are the guiding principles of
inquiry/reasoning. Among these principles are those that are built in
from the outset. These given principles are integral to the
inquiry/reasoning process and include the provided, fundamental
structure and function of inquiry/reasoning. They include, for
example, the ability to transit from inquiring/reasoning to resolved
states, the definition of those states, the grammar of expressions,
the rules of logic, the ability to access sources of information, and
so on. Other principles, not taken for granted, are constructs either
generated from acts of inquiry/reasoning or externally provided.</P>
<H3>Behavior</H3>
<P>The inquiring/reasoning agent behaves in accordance with what it
knows or what it is motivated to learn. It either knows what a given
occasion calls for (including a report of &quot;don't know&quot;) or
knows what to do to find out. The behavior is composed of actions in
relation with the source of the motivation, with the object of
inquiry/reasoning, and with the basis for inquiry/reasoning. Typical
behaviors of a reasoning system include requests for information,
either from internal memory or from outside data repositories, the
composition and decomposition of concepts, ..... In our example, the
expected behavior would be a report of some kind to the mother by the
psychiatrist about Jean's condition. The next step might be to
determine what do do about that condition, if anything.</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The structure of TRICEPS is an
instantiation of this model with components corresponding to those
described above.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &quot;inquirer/reasoner&quot; is
the TRICEPS system itself. As mentioned above, there are several
systematic and functional requirements that support the
inquirer/reasoner role. Version 1 instantiates these in the following
manner:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Motivation: The system is
	motivated through a request (using HTTP) for the system's URL.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Interaction: The system interacts
	with its &quot;object of inquiry/reasoning&quot; by composing a
	display to query the user and/or by accessing the value of generated
	nodes.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Conception: Version 1 of the
	system instantiates the differentiae very simply, that is, in the
	form of unique strings corresponding to concepts in the DSM-IV and
	DISC domain.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Episodic Memory: The system stores
	the datum produced through each interaction in association with the
	action that produced it and with its concept in a new node, a
	collection of which is stored as evidence. In version 1, the
	knowledge of the system is &quot;primed&quot; by composing the nodes
	that comprise the schedule. These nodes are theoretically the same
	as the new nodes generated by /reasoning (interview). Practically,
	and for now, however, they are handled separately.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Resolution: The mechanism for
	doubt resolution in version 1 is the sequential consideration of all
	the nodes in the schedule. Allowance is made for suspending and
	resuming the inquiry/reasoning. Once the question is resolved, the
	session is completed.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &quot;object of inquiry/reasoning&quot;
has aspects that are pre-defined, definable by the author, and
develop as the system generates new nodes. At a fundamental level it
consists of the entities with which the system has been constructed
to be able to interact. In version 1, this means with whoever
provides input to the system through the GUI and with nodes stored in
the system's own memory. As these interactions occur, that is, as new
knowledge nodes are constructed, the objects of inquiry/reasoning may
be much more defined and complex according to the qualities of the
differentiated concepts and actions that are applicable. The system
will then act, for example, with respect to not just any parent but
Jean's parent or not with respect to ADHD but to the temporal pattern
of a symptom that participates in the ADHD disorder. (In subsequent
versions, the system will be able to interact at the more fundamental
level with more &quot;objects&quot;, e.g., with URLs via HTTP,
external knowledge bases, or devices like cameras or microphones.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &quot;inquiring/reasoning and
resolved states&quot; are instantiated in version 1 through
evaluation of the action dependencies of each considered node. The
whole system is in a resolved state once loaded by the web server
where it awaits a request. Once a request arrives the system is in an
inquiring/reasoning state until suspended or until the interview is
completed (which presumably would answer the overarching question
about the subject and ADHD). The sub-states of the system, as it
handles the subsidiary actions implied by the overarching motivation,
are instantiated in the consideration and resolution of each node in
the schedule.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The system functions as a Java servlet
in concert with a servlet-enabled web server. Version 1 takes
advantage of the servlet session mechanism to provide a common
logical context within which each part of the inquiry/reasoning takes
place. In a general sense, this session is the &quot;occasion&quot;
that characterizes the inquiry/reasoning. In a more detailed sense,
however, each activation of a node is an occasion of knowledge and so
there are, in the accomplishment of a DISC interview many such
sub-occasions as each new node is generated.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &quot;motivation&quot; is presented
to the system both from outside and as a consequence of previously
posed questions, that is, as implied from what is currently known.
For example, the initial request for the system's URL corresponds to
posing the question to the system, &quot;Does the child Jean have
ADHD?&quot; The answer to this question requires the resolution of
subsidiary questions (asked of the subject) like, &quot;Do you
dislike activities that requiring you to pay attention for long
periods of time?&quot; The inquiry/reasoning is complete when the top
level question and all subsidiary questions are resolved. In Version
1, the initial motivation is coincident with the request for the URL
and further motivation is determined by sequentially considering each
node and evaluating its action dependencies.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The &quot;basis for inquiry/reasoning&quot;
in the TRICEPS system is essentially composed by the discrete
organization of concepts, actions, and data. In version 1 this is
accomplished with the following components:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the information stored in the
	spreadsheet that defines a schedule</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the system's action-parsing
	ability</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the data type handling</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">the servlet and other Java-based
	functionality</P>

	evidence</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally the system reports what it
knows. The &quot;knowledge&quot; of a version 1 system is reported
cumulatively during the course of an interview as answers to
questions are given and as the system evaluates those answers and
processes them.</P>
