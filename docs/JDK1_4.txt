Notes of how J2DK 1.4 can be used to improve Dialogix:

N.B. -- this elimiates the possibility of putting it on a handheld; although even 1.2 is not supported


(1) java.util.loggging
	- Logger.global -- does all
	- Logger.getAnonymousLogger(ResourceBundle) -- so can have separate logger for each instance of an interview
	- new Logger(name,ResourceBundle) -- could do the same, but even have separate loggers for each class (e.g as in Node, parser, etc.)
		- how am I currently using this?  The named logger method may be sufficient!
	- Logger.logp() -- can pass message, or MessageFormat -- means that no longer need Triceps object for logging purposes.  May still need it for rest of state info
	- Formatters -- XML, simple, etc.
	- efficiency -- different logging levels, rather than needing hard-coded DEBUG flag
	- MemoryHandler -- efficient, and rotating log -- so could be used for unlogged events (like most Loggers I'm using)
	- FileHandler -- supports rotating logs automatically
	
(2) java.util.regex
	- Good Perl5-like regular expression handling
	- means could remove need for Jakarta-ORO?  
	
(3) Java Web-Start
	- for deployment?
	-- read more on web-site
	
(4) JspC
	- this is in Ant 1.5
	- precompiles JSP files
