		<LI>original
		<LI>classification
		<UL>
			<LI>                     Although this list is not meant to be all-inclusive, most protected works fall into one
			of the specified<BR>
			                     categories. These categories are broader than they initially appear to be. For example, computer<BR>
			                     programs and most compilations are registered as &quot;literary works,&quot; while maps and
			architectural plans<BR>
			                     are registered as &quot;pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.&quot;
		</UL>
		<LI>fixation
		<LI>automatic creation - not necessary to attach a (c) copyright clause
		<UL>
			<LI>Automatic Creation: The above three requirements are the only requirements for copyright<BR>
			                     protection. As a result, copyright protection exists the moment an original work of authorship
			becomes<BR>
			                     fixed. For example, the song in the previous example is protected by copyright at the moment
			it is<BR>
			                     written to paper, or recorded on a cassette tape. A computer program is protected the exact
			moment<BR>
			                     that it is saved to disk.<BR>
			<BR>
			                     No other actions are required for copyright protection. There is no need to file an application
			for<BR>
			                     copyright protection, or to even place a copyright notice on a work. These additional steps,
			often<BR>
			                     referred to as &quot;formalities,&quot; were previously required to secure copyright protection.
			Under the current<BR>
			                     law, the formalities of registration and notice now merely serve as recommended steps to expand
			the<BR>
			                     protection provided by copyright (see the discussion on copyright formalities for more information).<BR>
			<BR>
			                     This automatic creation of copyright protection in the United States began in 1978. Before
			1978,<BR>
			                     statutory copyright was generally secured by the act of publishing a work with a notice of
			copyright on<BR>
			                     the work. If a work remained unpublished, statutory copyright could be secured by the act
			of<BR>
			                     registration. If a work was published without a copyright notice, the work could enter the
			public domain<BR>
			                     and would not have copyright protection. Any work that was in the public domain on January
			1, 1978<BR>
			                     remained in the public domain.
			<LI>compilation copyrights - protecting a grouping of facts - would this apply to diagnostic instruments?
			<UL>
				<LI>                     A grouping of facts is also protected as a compilation, assuming the grouping contains
				enough original<BR>
				                     expression to merit protection. An example of a protectable grouping of facts would be the
				links to<BR>
				                     other web sites found in the BitLaw legal links section. Each link consists merely of factual
				information,<BR>
				                     namely that a particular web site can be found at a particular URL location. Thus, there is
				no copyright<BR>
				                     protection for the links. Although the individual links can be copied and placed unto another
				web site, if<BR>
				                     the entire list (or a substantial portion) of the list were copied, the copyright in the compilation
				would be<BR>
				                     infringed. The creative, original expression that is being protected is the sorting, selecting,
				and grouping<BR>
				                     of all the legal oriented web sites into the ordered legal list found on these pages.

	<LI>Works unprotected by Copyright 
	<UL>
		<LI>Ideas, procedures, principles, discoveries, and devices are all specifically excluded from copyright<BR>
		                     protection. As stated in the Copyright Act:<BR>
		<BR>
		                         In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any
		idea,<BR>
		                         procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery,<BR>
		                         regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in
		such<BR>
		                         work.<BR>
		<BR>
		                     This specific exclusion helps maintain the distinction between copyright protection and patent
		law. Ideas<BR>
		                     and inventions are the subject matter for patents, while the expression of ideas is governed
		by copyright<BR>
		                     law. If copyright were extended to protect ideas, principles and devices, then it would be
		possible to<BR>
		                     circumvent the rigorous prerequisites of patent law and secure protection for an invention
		merely by<BR>
		                     describing the invention in a copyrightable work.
		<LI>Blank forms not copyrightable
		<UL>
			<LI>                     A second, less expected result of the idea/expression dichotomy is the inability to obtain
			copyright<BR>
			                     protection for blank forms. Although graphical or literary elements that might be found on
			a form (such<BR>
			                     as a photograph or a detailed explanation of a term) would be subject to copyright protection,
			there is<BR>
			                     no copyright in the blank form itself. The blank form is considered to be a type of idea,
			a conclusion<BR>
			                     which stems from an old Supreme Court decision. (<A HREF="http://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/unprotected.html">bitrate</A>)
		</UL>
		<LI>Useful Articles - what about diagnostic instruments?
		<UL>
			<LI>Useful articles: Copyright protection is generally not available to articles which have a utilitarian<BR>
			                     function. Examples of these types of &quot;useful articles&quot; would include lamps, bathroom
			sinks, clothing, and<BR>
			                     computer monitors. Under the Copyright Act, the only copyright protection available to these
			items is<BR>
			                     for &quot;features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently
			of, the<BR>
			                     utilitarian aspects of the article.&quot; Unfortunately, this test is inherently ambiguous
			when deciding the scope<BR>
			                     of copyright protection for certain useful articles.
			<LI>One of the primary purposes for prohibiting copyright protection in useful articles is to prevent the<BR>
			                     granting of patent-like protection through the copyright laws. If a useful article was protected
			under the<BR>
			                     copyright law, the protection against copying would be quite similar to patent protection.
			Since<BR>
			                     copyrights are so much easier to obtain than patents, there would be no way of limiting this
			patent-like<BR>
			                     monopoly to inventions that are truly novel and non-obvious. (For more discussion on patent
			protection,<BR>
			                     see the BitLaw discussion on patents).
			<LI>Another interesting copyright concern is the extent of copyright protection in pictoral or sculptural works<BR>
			                     that portray a useful article. Take, for example, a painting of a futuristic looking automobile.
			Copyright<BR>
			                     protection would prevent the outright copying of the painting. In addition, copyright law
			would prevent<BR>
			                     the creation of a three-dimensional model of the automobile found in the painting. However,
			under the<BR>
			                     specific terms of the Copyright Act, copyright law would not prevent General Motors from making
			a<BR>
			                     working (hence utilitarian) automobile of the design found in the painting.
			<LI>[This seems to suggest that creating a computerized version of a copyrighted instrument, by being utilitarian,
			is not a violation]
			<LI>[Since a fact, as an idea, is not copyrightable, then the formula for calculating a diagnostic score should
			not be protected?]

	<LI>Scope of Protection
	<UL>
		<LI>Five rights granted to owner of the work
		<UL>
			<LI>reproduce
			<UL>
				<LI>The reproduction right is perhaps the most important right granted by the Copyright Act. Under this<BR>
				                     right, no one other than the copyright owner may make any reproductions or copies of the work.<BR>
				                     Examples of unauthorized acts which are prohibited under this right include photocopying a
				book,<BR>
				                     copying a computer software program, using a cartoon character on a t-shirt, and incorporating
				a<BR>
				                     portion of another's song into a new song.<BR>
				
			</UL>
			<LI>prepare derivative works
			<UL>
				<LI>The right to make a derivative work overlaps somewhat with the reproduction right. According to<BR>
				                     the Copyright Act, a derivative work is<BR>
				<BR>
				                         a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical<BR>
				                         arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
				art<BR>
				                         reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast,<BR>
				                         transformed, or adapted. <BR>
				<BR>
				                     A derivative work usually involves a type of transformation, such as the transformation of
				a novel into a<BR>
				                     motion picture. In the computer industry, a second version of a software program is generally<BR>
				                     considered a derivative work based upon the earlier version.<BR>
				
				<LI>[Is this how diagnostic instruments are protected?]
			</UL>
			<LI>distribute copies
			<LI>perform the work publicly
			<UL>
				<LI>The public performance right is generally held to cover computer software, since software is considered<BR>
				                     a literary work under the Copyright Act. In addition, many software programs fall under the
				definition of<BR>
				                     an audio visual work. The application of the public performance right to software has not
				be fully<BR>
				                     developed, except that it is clear that a publicly available video game is controlled by this
				right.

	<LI>Limitations to Copyright - Fair Use
	<UL>
		<LI>The fair use statute: The doctrine of fair use developed over the years as courts tried to balance the<BR>
		                     rights of copyright owners with society's interest in allowing copying in certain, limited
		circumstances.<BR>
		                     This doctrine has at its core a fundamental belief that not all copying should be banned,
		particularly in<BR>
		                     socially important endeavors such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research.<BR>
		<BR>
		                     Although the doctrine of fair use was originally created by the judiciary, it is now set forth
		in the<BR>
		                     Copyright Act. Under the Act, four factors are to be considered in order to determine whether
		a<BR>
		                     specific action is to be considered a &quot;fair use.&quot; These factors are as follows:<BR>
		<BR>
		                       1.the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature
		or is for<BR>
		                         nonprofit educational purposes; <B>[research excluded?]</B><BR>
		                       2.the nature of the copyrighted work; <BR>
		                       3.the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work
		as a whole;<BR>
		                         and <BR>
		                       4.the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
		<B>[what if the market or value are increased?] </B>
		<LI>Reverse Engineering
		<UL>
			<LI><BR>
			                     In the context of computer technologies, the fair use doctrine is often used in the context
			of reverse<BR>
			                     engineering. Under trade secret principles, it is generally accepted to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;
			a product to<BR>
			                     determine how the product works. Reverse engineering may involve analyzing circuit board layouts,<BR>
			                     &quot;peeling&quot; back a integrated circuit chip, or decompiling computer software. However,
			it is impossible to<BR>
			                     decompile software and then analyze the results without making a copy (or a derivative work)
			of the<BR>
			                     software. Courts have sometimes held that the making of these copies in the context of reverse<BR>
			                     engineering is a fair use and is not copyright infringement.

	</UL>
	<LI>Ownership
	<UL>
		<LI>Joint Ownership
		<UL>
			<LI>Joint Authorship: When several people work together to create a single work, a joint work may be<BR>
			                     created under the Copyright Act. A joint work is defined by the Copyright Act as:<BR>
			<BR>
			                         a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be<BR>
			                         merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole. <BR>
			<BR>
			                     Under this definition, both authors must intend that their contributions be combined, and
			this intention<BR>
			                     must exist at the time the contribution is created. It is not necessary, however, that the
			contributions be<BR>
			                     equal in effort or value. Nor is it necessary that the joint authors work in the same physical
			area or at the<BR>
			                     same time. As defined in the statute, the only requirement is that both authors have the intention
			that the<BR>
			                     works are to be &quot;merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			                     A typical example of a joint work is a song developed by a composer and a lyricist. If both
			parties<BR>
			                     intend for their contributions to be combined into a single song, the song is considered a
			joint work.<BR>
			                     However, if the lyricist actually wrote the lyrics intending that they serve merely as a poem,
			and the<BR>
			                     composer later wrote a tune for the poem, there would be no joint work. This would be true
			even<BR>
			                     though the composer intended to form a single work, since the lyricist did not have any such
			intention.<BR>
			<BR>
			                     The determination of whether a joint work is created can be crucial in determining each party's
			rights to<BR>
			                     the created work. If a joint work exists, then both authors are co-owners of an undivided
			interest in the<BR>
			                     entire work. One of the authors can use the entire work as they please without seeking permission
			from<BR>
			                     the other joint author(s). However, if a single author makes a profit through the exploitation
			of the joint<BR>
			                     work, then the profits will have to be shared with the other joint authors.<BR>
			<BR>
			                     If there is no &quot;joint work,&quot; then the combined efforts of multiple authors are considered
			separate works<BR>
			                     temporarily joined together. In the example of the lyricist and the composer who created their
			works<BR>
			                     without intending them to be combined, the authors can still agree to combine their works
			into a single<BR>
			                     song. However, neither party can use the work of the other party without their permission.
			Neither<BR>
			                     author would have any rights to the complete song other than what they agree to with the other
			author.
