JSP / Taglibs and Dialogix

(1) Authentication
	(a) Needs
		- only authorized access
		- checked as stateless - each time a page submitted
		- allow test subjects
		- what about usage on local machine?  Some optional security?
		- prevent direct access to instruments -- means that want a main servlet, and all associated are under WEB-INF (instead of separate?) -- this would be 
			massive re-organization.  Instead, prevent access to those dirs for now?  Or, have everything go through interceptor?
	(b) Use Cases
		(i) Login page
			- Enter username / password
			- if fails, give error page
				- if all restricted, then say who to contact
				- if unrestricted, then allow establishment of new account (New Account)
			- if succeeds, forward to ?? page?
		(ii) GET/POST based fill-in of username and password to get to unrestricted areas	
		
(2) Interceptor Filter
	(a) Needs
		- should be the only servlet accessible in web.xml -- forwards to all others
		- logs all accesses (like Jim's stuff)
		- centralized time-stamp / profiling
		- manages sessions (ensuring no duplicate form submissions?)
		- forwards to study interceptor / controller
		- check browser compatability
		- check for expired sessions (as opposed to just creating a new one each time)
		- invalidate completed sessions (do this elsewhere?)

(3) Database
	(a) Needs
		- singleton access to an instrument
		- pick proper instance of an instrument for the subject -- will probably need to pre-create a slew of them -- but can pass via GET/POST like this:
                /Dialogix/servlet/Dialogix?schedule=Tutorials/WEB-INF/working/tri12345.dat&DIRECTIVE=RESUME
		- fast DB/SQL driver -- either to file, memory, or back-end DB
	(b) Objects (can look at DB design for general studies? MHARS, etc?)
		Instrument (can imagine auto-building instrument table when they are uploaded)
